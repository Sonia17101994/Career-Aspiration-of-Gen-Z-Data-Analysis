Generation Z, or Gen Z, is the group of people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. As they think about their future jobs, a few things stand out:

1. Tech and Business: Gen Z really likes technology and starting their own businesses. Jobs related to computers, data, and creating new things are appealing to them.

2. Making a Difference: They care about making the world better. Many want jobs where they can help others or work on big problems like climate change and fairness.

3. Work Anywhere, Anytime: Gen Z likes flexibility. They want jobs that let them work from home or choose when they work. A good balance between work and personal life is important to them.

4. Always Learning: Gen Z knows the world is changing fast. They want jobs that let them keep learning new things so they can stay on top of what's happening.

5. Everyone Included: Gen Z thinks everyone should be treated fairly, no matter where they're from or who they are. They like jobs in places that respect diversity and make everyone feel welcome.

6. Thinking Global: They're interested in jobs that connect them to the whole world. Working in different countries or for companies that have a big impact on the world appeals to them.

So, in simple terms, Gen Z wants jobs that involve cool technology, help others, offer flexibility, let them keep learning, treat everyone fairly, and maybe even have a global touch.
